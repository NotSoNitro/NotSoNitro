# Hey, I'm NotSoNitro ✨
This is the place where you can learn all about me and what i'm working on at the moment and all of my past, present and possibly future projects!

## Languages 🌱
Currently these are the languages I know:
- Python
- Lua
- C#
- Java
- HTML
- CSS

Im currently still learning and discovering newer languages! Hopefully you'll join me on this journey 😁

## Projects 🖥️
I'm currently working on a few projects like remaking my old discord bot and probably rewriting completely my Roblox GUI thing, any contributions or help would be greatly appreciated ❤️

## Other Information 💬
I really enjoy programming as it's one of my favourite hobbies, It also helps me pass the time whilst being productive, I want to develop stuff for anyone that would find my projects useful like for example my roblox GUI but it never really got any traction so I basically became demotivated extremely and burntout as I've spent over a year and a half on it. 😔

Sadly its tough being a developer, but hopefully this time I can actually make something that'll be useful for someone! Any help would be so appreciated as I've been a solo developer every since I've first started back in 2016. 😁

## Contact/Help 📫
If you'd like to help me on one of my [Projects](https://github.com/NotSoNitro/NotSoNitro/edit/main/README.md#contacthelp) then feel free to DM me on my [Discord](discord.com/users/505792168468807681) or just add me @notsonitr0

Here you can also contact me about anything as well!

## Fun Fact ⚡
I actually started programming on Roblox as something to do for fun since I used to use script which could be used via the `require()` function on roblox and i used to have over 30k scripts (crazy i know) and I wanted to make something similar to one of those scripts whcih was basically make an executor which can execute code to actually run these scripts.

This was all a learning experience for me and now I do much more better things which help the community, also funny enough I've made an executor so many times I've actually started to see myself getting better at making nice looking UI's and now I've also gained the skill of UX/UI Designing so theres a perk from all this as well 😅
